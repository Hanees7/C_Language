In a string, characters are indexed from left to right. For instance, in a string named hello the first character is at index 0, while the last is at index str.length-1 (i.e., at the 4th index).

We use the concept of indexing which means every character in a string corresponds to a number called the index number

               0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  - index number
     for eg - "C o d e C h e f"
Following are some of the ways we can access a specific character in a string in javascript:

using square brackets notation [ ]
var str = 'hello';
console.log(str[1]); // e
When we try to access a character whose index is equal to or larger than the string length, the square brackets [] return undefined.

var str = 'string';
console.log(str[999]); // undefined
using charAt() method This method will return the character at a specified index in a string. The method takes in a parameter, an integer that represents the index of the character to be returned. The syntax for usage is string.charAt(index).
var str = 'string';
console.log(str.charAt(0)); // s
//If no character is found, the method returns an empty string.
var str = 'string';
console.log(str.charAt(999)); // ''
Note

Indexing always starts from 0 when going left to right.
So the first character of a string str is s[0] , the second is s[1] , and so on.
Task
Write a program which does the following

Create a string variable word and assign the text Programming to it
Print the characters o and r from the string word in separate lines using the syntax defined above
OUTPUT:
// your code goes here
var word = "Programming";
console.log(word[2]+" "+word[4]);
