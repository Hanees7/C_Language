In JavaScript, strings are immutable, which means you cannot directly update or change a character in a string. For example

var name = "Chaf";
name[2] = 'e'; // nothing changes.
console.log(name); // Chaf
If you run the above program, you will still get the same string Chaf.

However, you can create a new string with the desired changes.
Here's an example of how you can replace the character

var name = "Chaf"
var newName = name.replace('a', 'e');
console.log(newName); // Chef
Note: If there are multiple occurrences of the substring you're trying to replace within the original string, the replace() method in JavaScript by default only replaces the first occurrence of the substring. For eg:

var name = "Chafaf";
var newName = name.replace('a', 'e');
console.log(newName); // Chefaf
Task
Write a program which does the following

Given a string variable word which has value "Ocygen".
You now want to fix the typo in the given string.
Use the syntax explained above to replace 'c' with 'x' in a new variable newWord
Output the updated newWord to console
OUTPUT :
// Complete the code

var word = "Ocygen";
var newWord = word.replace("c", "x");
console.log(newWord);
