You access an array element by referring to the index number inside square brackets [ ].
Similar to what we saw in strings, array items are indexed and you can access them by referring to their index number:

            0      1      2      - index numbers
         ["red","Green","Blue"]  - the array
Note - Indexing always starts from 0 when going left to right.

Write a program which does the following

Output the 3rd element from the given array to the console.
OUTPUT:
// Solution as follows

var nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

console.log(nums[2]);
