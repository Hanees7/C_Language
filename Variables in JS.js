A variable is like a labelled box where you can store data. Imagine you have a box labelled "age" and you put the number 25 in it. In JavaScript, you would do this by writing var age = 25; (one of the ways, we'll learn about rest soon). This means you're storing the number 25 in the variable named age.

Here's the cool part: whenever you use age in your code, JavaScript will remember it is 25. For example, if you write console.log(age), JavaScript will show 25.

Task
Create a variable in the editor named age and assign the value 25 to it.
Print the value of age variable using a console statement.
Notice how we don't use " " (double quotes) when printing variables.
  OUTPUT :
//Complete the code (replace the underscore with required value)

var age = 25;
console.log(age);
