The string type is used to store a sequence of characters, i.e. text.
String values can be surrounded by either double quotes or single quotes. JS does not care about whether you use single or double quotes.

For example, both the below codes do the same thing: Declare a variable with value I am using CodeChef.

var sentence1 = "I am using CodeChef";
var sentence2 = 'I am using CodeChef';
Task
Write a program which does the following

Declare two variables a and b
Assign Learning to a and is fun! to b
Display the sentence "Learning is fun!" using variables a and b in a single line
OUTPUT :
// your code goes here
const a ="Learning "; 
const b ="is fun!"
console.log(a+b)
