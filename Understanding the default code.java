Let's learn about the different elements of a Java program:

Let's take this example code:

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println(12 + 7);
	}
}
Class Declaration: class Codechef

This line begins with the keyword class, which tells Java that you're defining a new class.
Codechef is the name of this class. In Java, every piece of code lives inside a class.
Note that there is no semicolon at the end of class declaration
Main Method: public static void main (String[] args)

This line defines the "main method". It's like the main entrance to a house; the execution of a Java program starts from here.
We will learn more about it when we learn about functions and methods.
main is the name of this method. It's a special name that Java looks for when running a program.
Note that there is no semicolon at the end of Main method
System.out.print Statement: System.out.println(12 + 7);

We have already learned about this in a previous lesson.
Curly Braces {}:

The opening curly brace { after Codechef and main (String[] args) indicate the start of the class and method block respectively.
The closing curly braces } indicate the end of these blocks.
This code, when run, will simply display 19 on the screen, which is the sum of 12 and 7.

Don't worry if all of this is a little too much for you. You will get used to all of this as you move ahead in the course. If you have any doubts about the concept right now, click on the help tab above and ask your question to get clarification.

Task
Now that we have some idea of what these lines mean. I want you to write the complete code in the editor. It will help you in remembering all the lines.

Write the exact code which we discussed in this lesson, to output the sum of 12 and 7. If you miss anything like uppercase S in System and String, you will get an error, don't worry, just ask about the error in Help tab.
OUTPUT :

// Write complete code to print the sum of 12 and 7
// Be careful about uppercase and lowercase letters

class Cdechef{
    public static void main (String [] args){
        System.out.println( 12 + 7);
    }
}
