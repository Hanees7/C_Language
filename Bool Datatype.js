In programming, you often need to make decisions based on whether something is true or false. For this, we have a data type, called Boolean representing just one of these two values - true and false.

You can create a boolean variable like this:

var studying = true;
console.log(studying);

// Output:
// true
Note how we do not have to provide quotes around the value true.

Task
Complete the given program which should do the following:

Declare two variables x and y
Assign the value true to x and the value false to y
Output x and y space separated on a single line
OUTPUT :
// Replace the underscores with required values

var x = true;
var y = false;

console.log(x, y);
