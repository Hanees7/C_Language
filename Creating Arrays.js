Arrays are a fundamental data structure in JavaScript that allows you to store and organize collections of data. Whether you're dealing with a list of numbers, strings, or more complex objects, arrays provide a convenient way to manage and manipulate your data.

Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.

In JS, an array is denoted by square brackets [ ]

It can hold elements of different data types, such as numbers, strings, or even other lists.
Arrays are mutable, which means you can modify them by adding, removing, or changing elements.
Consider the array 'fruits' and 'numbers' below

var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"];

var numbers = [20, 10, 0, -5];
Task
Write a program which does the following

Create an Array of the first 5 positive integers - name it integers
Once the array is defined - output "Done" to the console.
OUTPUT :
// your code goes here
var fruits = [1, 2, 3,4 ,5];
console.log("Done")
