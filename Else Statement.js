As evident from previous example, the else keyword includes anything which isn't included in the previous if or else if conditions.

Task
Some code is written in the editor.

Two variables ram and karan are defined.
Output based on these conditions:
If ram is greater than karan, output "Ram is heavier than Karan"
If ram is less than karan, output "Karan is heavier than Ram"
Otherwise, output "Ram & Karan have the same weight!"
Your task is to complete the blanks in the code.
  OUTPUT :
var ram = 74;
var karan = 82;

if (ram > karan) {
    console.log("Ram is heavier than Karan");
} else if(ram < karan) {
    console.log("Karan is heavier than Ram");
} else {
    console.log("Ram & Karan have the same weight!");
}
    
ram = 78
karan = 78

if (ram > karan){
    console.log("Ram is heavier than Karan");
} else if(ram < karan) {
    print("Karan is heavier than Ram");
} else {
    console.log("Ram & Karan have the same weight!");
}
