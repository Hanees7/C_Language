Write a program for the following problem

Letâ€™s consider a rectangle of sides 11 and 13.
Output the following on separate lines:
Area of the rectangle having sides as 11 and 13
Perimeter of the rectangle having sides as 11 and 13
For any rectangle, the formula for area is length * breadth.
The formula for perimeter is 2 * (length + breadth)
OUTPUT :
// Update the '__'  (underscores) below to solve the problem

console.log(11 *13)        // Area of the rectangle

console.log(2*(11 + 13))    // Perimeter of the rectangle
