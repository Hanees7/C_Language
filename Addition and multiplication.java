Basic math - Addition and multiplication
Basic math and logic based programming problems are the correct starting point for Beginners.

In the previous module, we have learnt how to accept multiple inputs and test cases
The current module will use our knowledge of Java syntax and learnings from the previous module
Task
Lets start with a simple problem - you need to write a program which does the following

Accepts the number of inputs / test cases as '
�
t'
The only line of each test case contains 2 integers - declare them as variables 
�
A and 
�
B
For each test case, you need to perform the following operations
Create a variable - 
�
S - the sum of the 2 input integers
Create a variable - 
�
P - the product of the 2 input integers
Output 2 space separated integers - 
�
S and 
�
P in a single line
Note:

The syntax for product of 2 integers in Java is (
�
X * 
�
Y)
Sample 1:
Input
Output
2
5 10
3 4
15 50
7 12
Explanation:
Test case 1: The 2 integers are 
5
5 and 
10
10 and we output 
15
15 as their sum and 
50
50 as their product

Test case 2: The 2 integers are 
3
3 and 
4
4 - we output 
7
7 and 
12
12 as their sum and product respectively

OUTPUT :

// Update the '_' in the code below
import java.util.Scanner;

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args)
	{
	    Scanner read = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int t = read.nextInt();
		for(int i=0; i<t; i++)
		{
            // Accept 2 integers inputs
        	int a = read.nextInt();
        	int b = read.nextInt();
        	
        	// Sum of inputs
        	int s = a + b;
        	
        	// Product of inputs
        	int p = a * b;
        	
        	// Print the desired output for each test case
        	System.out.println(s + " " + p);
		}
	}
}
